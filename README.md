### Markdown Formatting Tips:
1. **Headers**: Use `#` for main headers, `##` for sub-headers, and so on.
2. **Bold text**: Wrap text in `**` for bold.
3. **Code blocks**: Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code blocks and single backticks (\`) for inline code.
4. **Links**: Use `[link text](URL)` for clickable links.

### Additional Tips:
- You can use an editor like **Visual Studio Code** or **Typora** that provides a preview of Markdown to see how your formatting looks as you write.
- Make sure to replace placeholder texts, such as the GitHub repository link and database configuration values, with your actual values.
